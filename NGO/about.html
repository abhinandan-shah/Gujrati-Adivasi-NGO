      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p><strong>Gujarat Adivasi NGO</strong> is a grassroots organization working at the intersection of social equity and indigenous empowerment. Our aim is to create sustainable systems that address the educational, medical, and livelihood challenges faced by tribal communities.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, we have partnered with local leaders, educators, and healthcare professionals to deliver impactful solutions. From launching village schools and health outreach programs to enabling microenterprise through vocational training, our focus remains community-first.</p>
      <p>We are proud to support over 40 villages across Gujarat with continuous development programs designed to preserve tribal heritage while opening doors to modern opportunities.</p>

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p><strong>An inclusive Gujarat</strong> where every tribal child has access to education, every household has access to healthcare, and every community has the tools to thrive sustainably.</p>

      <h2>Core Values</h2>
      <ul class="project-list">
        <li>Empowerment through education and awareness</li>
        <li>Transparency and accountability in operations</li>
        <li>Preserving cultural identity alongside development</li>
        <li>Building community leadership and ownership</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Real-Life Experiences</h2>
      <p><strong>Rita Ben, Dahod District:</strong> “Before the NGO came, my daughters had never stepped into a school. Today, both of them attend classes daily. They dream of becoming teachers, and I finally have hope for their future.”</p>

      <p><strong>Mangya Bhai, Narmada Region:</strong> “I used to walk 15 km to reach a clinic. Now the mobile health van visits every month. I no longer worry about my children falling sick without help.”</p>

      <p><strong>Kalpana, Vocational Training Participant:</strong> “I never thought I could run my own tailoring business. The training gave me confidence and the micro-loan helped me buy a sewing machine. Now I support my family independently.”</p>

      <p><strong>Suresh, Youth Volunteer:</strong> “Being part of this NGO has given me purpose. I help organize children’s classes and awareness sessions. It feels great to serve my community.”</p>
